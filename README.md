**Welcome to 5CM507 Graphics @ University of Derby - a practcal computer graphics module for games !**

I’m excited to have you join us for this journey into the world of computer graphics, spanning from the autumn term to the spring term. In the autumn term, you will learn the fundamentals of classical computer graphics, with the use of OpenGL, OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and C++.

To put it simple, this is a module of **practcal computer graphics for games**. We are not going to cover the deep theoretic parts of computer graphics, but throughout the course, you’ll gain hands-on experience with a variety of essential topics related to computer grames.

In term 1, you are going to learn traditional rasterisation graphics pipeline programming, including:

* **3D Transformations**: Learn how to manipulate objects in a three-dimensional space. 3D rotations wil be a bit hard.
* **Scenegraph and Hierarchical Modeling**: Develop complex models by combining simpler components in a structured manner. This is closely related to transformations.
* **Viewing and Projection**: Understand how to create different perspectives and project 3D scenes onto a 2D screen.
* **Lighting and Shading**: From basi Blinn-Phong lighting model to more advanced physically based lighting models. Lighting is the most essential part of rendering.
* **Texture Mapping**: You can apply images to 3D models to enhance their appearance. You will also learn fragment programming skills.
* **Basic spatial data structure and collision detection.**



In term 2, you are going to learn more advanced contents, including ray tracing, animation and physical simulation.

Whether you're aiming to be a game developer or advanced graphics and GPU expert, this module will help you with the skills and knowledge needed to bring your ideas to life. I’m looking forward to seeing your creativity in action as we explore the fascinating world of computer graphics together.Jump right in
