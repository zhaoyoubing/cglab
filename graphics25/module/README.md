# Module

## Code

5CM507 Graphics, 2025-26, University of Derby

## Description

This module explores the theory and application of rendering techniques and technologies. The module provides an understanding of low-level graphics rendering techniques explored via graphics APIs, and an introduction to modern rendering technologies and their implementation within modern games engines. Examples include 3D mathematics for graphics, the rendering pipeline, transformations, game engines, recent developments in graphics, etc. Lectures introduce the fundamental theory and provide practical examples of the main concepts and algorithms. Laboratory sessions provide the framework for the development and implementation of graphics applications.

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module, students will be able to:

1\.     Demonstrate standard computer graphics algorithm implementations using a graphics API.

2\.     Develop graphics solutions using a modern rendering engine.

## Content

The module content covers the theory and practical aspects of rendering techniques and technologies in graphics and within modern game engines and APIs.&#x20;

Revovling around following topics

Modelling (transformations, meshes, scenegraph, particle systems, etc.)

Lighting (Blinn-Phong, BRDF, GGX, Global Illumination, etc.)

Rendering and Sampling (Rasterisation, Ray tracing, AI)

GPU and shaders (Rendering pipelines and shader programming)

Animation and Simulation (character animation, collision detection)

Game Engine Technologies (shadows, terrains, level-of-detail, real-time ray tracing, etc.)

## Features

4Rs: Real-time, Realistic, Rasterisation, Ray-tracing

## Schedule

This module is a THRU module which covers two terms of year 2 for  students on the game course. Please refer to the Schedule page for detailed schedules each term.

## Prerequisites

Linear Algebra (for 3D transformations)

Basic Calculus (for illumination, etc.)

C++
