# LabA01 Drawing 2D Triangles

## Lab Tutorial: Drawing Triangles with OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW

### Objective

This tutorial guides you through rendering triangles using OpenGL, Direct3D, WebGL or Vulkan

### Prerequisites

* C++ development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or GCC)
* OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW installed

***

## Tutorial

Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Step 2: Drawing  Raw Triangles

Step 3: Drawing Indexed Triangles

Step 4: Drawing Indexed Triangles with Vertex Colours

***

### Exercises

#### **Basic Exercises**

1. **Modify the Triangle Colour** – Change the colours of the triangle vertices to create a gradient effect.
2. **Change Triangle Positions** – Adjust the vertex coordinates to move the triangle around the screen.
3. **Add More Triangles** – Extend the program to render multiple triangles instead of just one.
4. **Resize the Window** – Modify the viewport and projection settings to maintain the correct aspect ratio when resizing.

#### **Intermediate Exercises**

5. **Revise the code to draw a 3D pyramid (no need to touch projections)**
6. **Revise the code to draw a 3D cube (no need to touch projections)**
