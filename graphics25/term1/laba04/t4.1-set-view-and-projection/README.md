# T4.1 Set View and Projection

In the last lab, we created the Mesh class and wrote its draw() method. However, we were still using the default view direction (looking at the centre with a direction of (0, 0, -1) )hard-coded orthographics projection in the Mesh::Draw() method.&#x20;

In this task, we are going to use view and projection matrices as arguments to Mesh::draw() to support perspective projection setting.
