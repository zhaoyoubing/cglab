# 4.1.2 Change Mesh::draw() Node::draw() signature

In this section, we are going to set perspective projection for our program. At the moment, we are still using hard-coded orthographics projection in the Mesh::Draw() method. Now we need to separate the projection.

We are going to add view matrix and projection matrix, in addition to the model transformation matrix  to Mesh::draw()

Mesh.cpp

```cpp
void Mesh::draw(glm::mat4 matModel, glm::mat4 matView, glm::mat4 matProj)
```

You need to change this in both Mesh.h and Mesh.cpp

In Node.h and Node.cpp, you are going to make simiar changes to Node::draw()

Node.cpp

```cpp
void Node::draw(glm::mat4 matModel, glm::mat4 matView, glm::mat4 matProj)
```
