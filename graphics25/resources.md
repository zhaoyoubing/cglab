## Books

There is no required textbook for this module. However, you may refer to the following books as textbooks.&#x20;

### Semester Autumn

### \[Practice] OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook, 3rd Ed.

For practical GLSL shader programming (highly recommended)

The key of computer graphics programming this term is shader programming, in addition to our lab sessions, you can get a quick start with this cookbook. Source code available on Github ([https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenGL-4-Shading-Language-Cookbook-Third-Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenGL-4-Shading-Language-Cookbook-Third-Edition))

### Semester Spring

In Term 2 we are going to learn basic ray tracing, animation and physical simulation. The following resources may be helpful, but some are for advanced learneers.

### \[Practice]  Ray tracing in one weekend

Ray tracing in one weekend. Book series on software-based ray tracing.

We are going to follow this tutorial for our ray tracing.&#x20;

It will also be very helful to your Term 2 coursework.

### Advanced

For advanced learners on ray tracing and pysically based rendering, you may refer to the following books:

#### Ray Tracing Gems II
